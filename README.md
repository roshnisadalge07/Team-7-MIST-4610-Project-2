## Dataset Overview

Our chosen dataset is titled "Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2020-2023", and it was obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The dataset shows the number of individuals who died from fourteen causes such as Natural Causes, Malignant Neoplasms, Diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's Disease, Influenza & Pneumonia, and COVID-19. 

The data is divided up by year (ranging from 2020-2023) and further specified by the week. The "Jurisdiction" column of the dataset refers to the geographic location of where these deaths occurred. The death counts are first grouped by the United States and then categorized by state. Each row has the location of occurrence, the week of the year, the total count of deaths for all causes, and then the number of deaths for the individual causes. 

Through this information, we are able to analyze the cause of death trends and draw conclusions relating to the various factors that may have impacted these values.
