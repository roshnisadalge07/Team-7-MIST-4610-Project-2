## Dataset Overview
Our chosen dataset is titled "Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2020-2023", and it was obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The dataset shows the number of individuals who died from fourteen causes such as Natural Causes, Malignant Neoplasms, Diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's Disease, Influenza & Pneumonia, and COVID-19. 

The data is divided up by year (ranging from 2020-2023) and further specified by the week. The "Jurisdiction" column of the dataset refers to the geographic location of where these deaths occurred. The death counts are first grouped by the United States and then categorized by state. Each row has the location of occurrence, the week of the year, the total count of deaths for all causes, and then the number of deaths for the individual causes. 

Through this information, we can analyze the cause of death trends and draw conclusions relating to the various factors that may have impacted these values.

## Question 1
How do mortality trends for COVID-19 and Influenza & Pneumonia compare across different states from 2020-2023?

We chose to represent this question visually through two bar graphs. Each bar is one of the fifty states and each year is represented by a different color on each bar.

## Question 2
What are the top five causes of death for the Southeast region compared to the United States, and how have these trends evolved over the years?

**IMAGE

We visualized this question through two line graphs combined through the Dashboard feature on Tableau; the top graph represented the Southeast region and the bottom graph represented the United States. The top five causes were natural causes, diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, COVID-19 as a multiple cause of death, and COVID-19 as an underlying cause of death. The states we included in the Southeast region were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

## Manipulations
For our second question, we decided to only focus on the top five causes of mortality and filtered out the other nine causes. The mortality rates for the excluded nine causes were incredibly similar, and we found that this made our graphs look messy and hard to read. By only showing the top five causes we could understand the graph better and make better conclusions based off the results.

## Analysis and Results
In terms of question one, we can see that mortality trends for both diseases are declining, reflecting the impact of public health interventions (e.g. vaccines and awareness campaigns). Mortality rates are higher in densely populated states and lower in states with fewer people, emphasizing regional differences. California, Florida, and Texas had the highest mortality rates for both causes and this could be attributed to their population size. (**ADD STATISTIC) COVID-19 is a novel virus, resulting in much higher mortality rates across all states. Influenza is a seasonal diseases with established vaccines and treatments, leading to lower or zero mortality in some states.

For our second question, natural causes maintain the leading causes of mortality throughout 2020-2023. COVID-19 spikes in 2020 and 2021, but tapers off in 2022 and 2023. Regardless, the deaths from natural causes, heart diseases, and malignant neoplasms were still higher than deaths from COVID-19. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms (cancerous tumors) showed relatively consistent patterns over the course of the four years yet continued to be significant contributors to overall mortality. For each cause of death, there was a downward trend from 2023-2024, which could indicate better healthcare and a higher quality of overall health. The gap between COVID-19 deaths and other causes of death began to widen from the end of 2021 to 2023, which again could show the progress made on handling the pandemic within the country. In terms of the Southeast region itself, the trends within the region reflected the trends within the United States very similarly. The number of deaths in the Southeast made up around 10% of the deaths in the United States.
